I am having a hard time adding in the actual HTML markups in the notes. Each time that I do it see that mark as something to perform.
<br>
Images do not require a closing Tag
<br>
A = anchor - also think of a link<br>BR =break<br>
P = paragraph<br>
BR = inline<br>
P = block<br>
P is like a text box <br>
B = <b>bold</b><br>
EM = <em>Italics</em><br>
IMG = image<img src="C:\Users\shawn\OneDrive\Pictures\Capture.PNG" alt="not found"><br>
